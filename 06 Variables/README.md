Tasks
 1. Write a shell script which prints current date and message:
Requirements:

Script should use current date and time, stored in variable
Script should print message, stored in variable
Output should be formatted as follows: [DATE] MESSAGE
Expected output:

[devops@localhost ~]$ ./message.sh
[Mon Sep 30 17:52:36 +03 2019] Hello, task2!
 

2. Run following script and fix errors
#!bin/bash
var1= "Hello, "
var2 = "broken"
var3 ="script!"
printf "%s %f %d" '$var1' "$var2" $var3
Example of corrected output:

[devops@localhost ~]$ ./fixed.sh
Hello, broken script!
 

3. Write a shell script which prints out value of global variable MY_VAR: 
Requirements:

Script should print out value of MY_VAR (defined outside the script)
If there is no value set for MY_VAR (no such variable in environment), script should print out default
Hint: check documentation
Expected output:

[devops@localhost ~]$ export MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ ./global.sh
MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ MY_VAR=my_value ./global.sh 
MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ unset MY_VAR  # reset variable
[devops@localhost ~]$ ./global.sh
MY_VAR=default
 

4. You can easily manipulate with string variables in bash. See the theory: https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html and perform the following tasks:
4.1 output 5 characters of substring from mystring at position=2 with one-line command
[devops@localhost ~]$ mystring=abcdefghijklmn
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${mystring:2:5}
cdefg
 

4.2 output hello variable with replacement word hello->goodbye with one-line command
[devops@localhost ~]$ hello="Hello world!"
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${hello????} #fill questions mark the right statement
Goodbye world!
 

4.3 output jesus variable with replacement all words from water to wine with one-line command
[devops@localhost ~]$ jesus="water wine water wine water wine"
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${jesus????} #fill questions mark the right statement
wine wine wine wine wine wine
 

4.4 youâ€™re given a variable with some path. Get parent path using string manipulating
[devops@localhost test_folder]$ mypath=$(pwd)
[devops@localhost test_folder]$ echo ${mypath}
/home/devops/test_folder
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${mypath?????} #fill questions mark right statement
/home/devops
