#### Task 3
Write a shell script which prints out value of global variable MY_VAR:<br/>

* Script should print out value of MY_VAR (defined outside the script)
* If there is no value set for MY_VAR (no such variable in environment), script should print out default
* Hint: check documentation

Expected output:
```bash
[devops@localhost ~]$ export MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ ./global.sh
MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ MY_VAR=my_value ./global.sh 
MY_VAR=my_value
[devops@localhost ~]$ unset MY_VAR  # reset variable
[devops@localhost ~]$ ./global.sh
MY_VAR=default
```

#### Task 4
You can easily manipulate with string variables in bash. See the theory: https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html and perform the following tasks:
#### 4.1 output 5 characters of substring from mystring at position=2 with one-line command
```bash
[devops@localhost ~]$ mystring=abcdefghijklmn
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${mystring:2:5}
cdefg
``` 
#### 4.2 output hello variable with replacement word hello->goodbye with one-line command
```bash
[devops@localhost ~]$ hello="Hello world!"
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${hello????} #fill questions mark the right statement
Goodbye world!
``` 
#### 4.3 output jesus variable with replacement all words from water to wine with one-line command
```bash
[devops@localhost ~]$ jesus="water wine water wine water wine"
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${jesus????} #fill questions mark the right statement
wine wine wine wine wine wine
``` 
#### 4.4 youâ€™re given a variable with some path. Get parent path using string manipulating
```bash
[devops@localhost test_folder]$ mypath=$(pwd)
[devops@localhost test_folder]$ echo ${mypath}
/home/devops/test_folder
[devops@localhost ~]$ echo ${mypath?????} #fill questions mark right statement
/home/devops
```
